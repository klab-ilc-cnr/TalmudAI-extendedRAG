* **16b** Returning to the text that said: These are the categories of slaves to whom gifts are given at their liberation: those who are freed upon reaching the sixth year, those who are freed at the arrival of the jubilee, those who are freed at the death of the master, and the Jewish female slave who shows signs of puberty; while gifts are not given to those who escape, and to those who are freed by paying the difference of the remaining years. Rabbi Meir says: Gifts are not given to those who escape, while gifts are given to those who are freed by paying the difference of the remaining years. Rabbi Shimon says: Gifts are given to four categories of slaves, three concerning men, and three concerning women, and you cannot say that there are four categories in either of the two, man or woman, since the signs of puberty do not concern men, and the piercing of the ear does not concern women.
* **16b** Rav Amram objected to Resh Laqish with a baraitah: These are the categories of slaves to whom gifts are given at their liberation: those who are freed upon reaching the age of six, those who are freed at the arrival of the jubilee, those who are freed at the death of the master, and the Jewish female slave who shows signs of puberty. And if it were as Resh Laqish taught, that the death of the father is also counted, let the death of the father be included among the categories that receive gifts!
* **17a** Rav Sheshet said: What case are we dealing with here? The case in which the slave had escaped, and in the meantime, the jubilee has arrived. You might have said: Since the jubilee releases him from the master's authority, he is considered as if he had been sent away by you, and he is not fined, and gifts are given to him at the time of liberation. Therefore, the baraitah teaches us that gifts are not given to one who had escaped from the master, even if in the meantime the jubilee has arrived.
* **16b** It is understandable that the gifts given at the liberation of the Jewish female slave are for her, as a verse comes to exclude the brothers, according to what has been taught in the baraitah: And you shall keep them as property to pass on to your children after you (Lev. 25:46), from which it is deduced: them, the slaves, to your sons, and not your daughters to your sons; and from here it is learned that a man does not bequeath to his son what belongs to his daughter. While the teaching that the gifts at the liberation of the Jewish slave are for him is obvious! If not for him, to whom would they go?
