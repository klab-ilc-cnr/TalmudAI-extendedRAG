* **24a**    It was taught in a baraita: A slave is freed if his master injures his tooth, eye, or extremities (rashè evarìm) which, if struck, do not grow back.
* **18a**    Our Masters taught in a baraita: There are rules for Jewish male slaves that do not apply to Jewish female slaves, and there are rules for Jewish female slaves that do not apply to Jewish male slaves: Jewish male slaves are freed after six years of service, at the arrival of the Jubilee, and upon the death of their master, which does not apply to Jewish female slaves; while there are rules that apply only to Jewish female slaves, as they are set free upon reaching puberty, cannot be sold twice, and can be redeemed against his will, which does not apply to Jewish male slaves.
* **6b** Rav Nachman said to Rav Ashi, and some say Rav Chanin of Mechozah said to Rav Ashi: Come and hear a proof from a baraita: If a master sells his Canaanite slave to a non-Jew, the slave goes free and needs a document of release from his first master in order to marry an Israelite woman. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what case is it said that he must write him a document of release? When the master has not written him a document called onò; whereas if he has written him a document onò, this is valid for his release. What is this document called onò? Rav Shèshet said: It is a document in which he wrote: “When you run away from this master, I will no longer have anything to do with you.”
* **14b**    The Jewish slave is acquired by the master with money or with the document, and acquires himself with years, at the jubilee, or with the deduction of money. The Jewish slave girl has an advantage over him, because she acquires herself with the signs of puberty. The nirtzà‘ is acquired by piercing the ear, and acquires himself at the jubilee, or at the death of the master.
* **21b** Rabbi Elazar said: Yudan Beribi explained: When they pierced the slave's ear, they did so on the lobe. Instead, the Sages say: A Jewish kohen slave cannot have his ear pierced, because this would result in him having a physical defect, and he would no longer be able to perform temple service.

* **jubilee** = After seven cycles of seven years, the fiftieth year is called the “year of jubilee” (see Lev. 25:8-13), during which all the agricultural prohibitions of the sabbatical year must be observed. In addition, all Jewish slaves, including those who had agreed to remain in slavery beyond the term of their obligation, regain their freedom, and all fields that had been sold are returned to their original owners. The liberation of slaves and the return of fields take place after Yom Kippur. At the end of the day of Kippur in the Jubilee year, the shofar is sounded. The rules of the Jubilee are only put into practice when the majority of the Jewish people live in the Land of Israel. Consequently, their observance was suspended at the end of the First Temple period, when the kingdom of Israel was destroyed and its inhabitants taken into exile, and has never been renewed.
