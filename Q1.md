# What is semikha and how does it relate to the laying on of hands?
## The Answer from LLM Only
A great question about Jewish law and tradition!

Semikhà (also known as Semikha or Semicha) refers to the rabbinic ordination, a process by which a rabbi confers authority and responsibility to another individual, typically a student, to render halakhic decisions and perform certain religious functions.

In the context of the Qiddushin tractate of the Babylonian Talmud, Semikhà is related to the imposition of hands (imposizione delle mani in Italian, or S'mikhah in Hebrew) as a symbol of transmission of authority and knowledge from one generation of scholars to the next.

According to the Talmud, the imposition of hands is a physical act where the rabbi places his hands on the head of the student, signifying the transfer of authority and responsibility. This act is seen as a continuation of the tradition of ordination that dates back to the time of Moses, who ordained Joshua by placing his hands on him (Numbers 27:18-23).

In the Qiddushin tractate, this concept is discussed in relation to the transmission of authority in the context of marriage and divorce. For example, in Qiddushin 49a, the Talmud discusses the importance of Semikhà in ensuring the continuity of halakhic tradition and the authority of the rabbis.

* Qiddushin 49a
* Qiddushin 59b

Please note that while the Qiddushin tractate discusses the concept of Semikhà and the imposition of hands, it does not provide a comprehensive explanation of the topic. Other Talmudic tractates, such as Sanhedrin, may provide additional information on this subject.

Semikha is a term that has two distinct meanings: one relating to sacrifices and the other relating to the transmission from master to disciple. In the sense relating to sacrifices, semikha refers to the laying of hands on the head of the animal to be sacrificed, which symbolically transfers the sins of the offerer onto the animal, and through the sacrifice, the sins are atoned for.

- **semikhà** = Pl.  semikhòt . From the root  s-m-kh , “to lay, to be close, to impose (hands)”. The term has two distinct meanings:  Semikhà  in sacrifices and  Semikhàt chakhamìm . 1.  Semikhà  in sacrifices: in this sense, the term has a technical meaning related to a phase of the offering of animals in sacrifice, the laying of hands on the head of the animal to be sacrificed. This rule is learned from the Torah in several passages (e.g., Lev. 1:4; Lev. 3:2, 8, 13; Lev. 16:21). The rule seems to symbolically mean that the sins of the offerer are transferred to the animal and through the sacrifice the sins are atoned for, as explicitly stated in Lev. 16:21. Maimonides (Rambam) writes that the laying on of hands was accompanied by widdui, the confession of sins, but this was only in the case of sacrifices of atonement, such as burnt offerings, while for shelamim (“reconciliation”) sacrifices, it seems that words of praise to the Lord were recited (Rambam, Ma‘asè haQorbanòt 3:15). The  semikhà  applies essentially to all sacrifices brought by individuals, except for the sacrifices of  bekhòr  (firstborn),  ma‘asèr  (tithe) and  qorbàn pèsach  (Passover sacrifice) (Rambam,  Ma‘asè haQorbanòt  3:6). The obligation of semikha does not apply to sacrifices offered by the entire public, except for the “scapegoat” of Kippur (Lev. 16:21) and the sacrifice called he'elem davar shel tzibbur (Lev. 4:13-15, see Rashi's commentary), that is, the bull offered in the event that the Sanhedrin has given an incorrect teaching: for these two sacrifices, the obligation of semikha applies even though they are public sacrifices (Rambam, Ma'ase haQorbanot 3:10). 2. Semikhat chakhamim. In the context of teacher-student transmission, the semikha chakhamim was the gesture of laying hands on the student's head, which marked the moment when the teacher authorized the student to be a decision-maker in both civil and criminal law. According to tradition, this transmission began with the semikha of Moshe to Yehoshua (see Num. end of chap. 27). At the time of Emperor Hadrian, the Romans tried to interrupt the continuity of the transmission by decreeing a ban on its implementation. Despite this, Yehuda ben Bava ordained five disciples who would be among the greatest tannaim of the fourth generation. In the time of Abbaye and Ravah, at the beginning of the fourth century, the transmission was definitively interrupted. According to Maimonides, the institution of semikha could be renewed if all the rabbis of a generation united and decided to do so. Today, the term semikha refers to rabbinical ordination, which includes the conferral of authority to establish Halakha (also known as hettèr horaà), given by a teacher to a student when the latter acquires the title of rabbi.
