* **13b**    And the other is that it is written: But if the latter hates her and writes her a bill of divorce, gives it to her in her hand, and sends her out of his house... or if the latter man who took her as his wife dies (Deut. 24:3), then the Torah connects the death of a husband to divorce: just as divorce completely allows a woman to remarry, so too does the death of a man completely allow a widow to remarry.
* **13b**    Perhaps, however, the rule could be interpreted in this sense: a widow who has no children is forbidden to marry other men, and she is allowed to marry her yavam; while she who has children is forbidden to all men!
* **13b**    Instead, the permission for a widow to remarry is learned from what the Scripture says: So that he may not die in battle, and another man take her (Deut. 20:7).
* **78b**    In the final part of the verse it is written: But a widow who is the widow of a kohèn, they shall take. From this we deduce that the widow of a kohèn is indeed permitted to a kohèn, while the widow of an Israelite is not permitted. However, in reality, even the widow of an Israelite is permitted to a simple kohèn. How is this possible?
* **13b**    Instead, the rule is learned from what the Torah says: a yevamah who has no children is forbidden to marry anyone except her husband's brothers, but if she had children, she would be allowed to remarry anyone after her husband's death!
