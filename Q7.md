# Do Jewish male and female slaves obtain freedom in the same way?
## The Answer from LLM Only
According to the Qiddushin tractate of the Babylonian Talmud, a Jewish male slave and a Jewish female slave do not obtain freedom in the same way.

A Jewish male slave can be freed through a document of manumission (a "get shichrur") or by being released by his master (Qiddushin 14b). On the other hand, a Jewish female slave can only be freed through a document of manumission (Qiddushin 22b).

Note: The Babylonian Talmud is a complex and nuanced text, and this answer is based on a specific interpretation of the relevant passages. Other interpretations may exist.

* **18a** Our Masters taught in a baraita: There are rules for the Jewish slave that do not apply to the Jewish female slave, and there are rules for the Jewish female slave that do not apply to the Jewish male slave: the Jewish male slave goes free after completing six years of labor, at the arrival of the Jubilee, and upon the death of the master, which does not apply to the Jewish female slave; while there are rules that pertain only to the Jewish female slave, as she goes free with the signs of puberty, cannot be sold twice, and can be redeemed against her will, which does not apply to the Jewish male slave.
* **72b** In reality, I could tell you that Shemu'el maintained that the prophet's cry was in homage to the virtues of Pelatyahu, and Shemu'el, when he said that there was no need to worry in Mishon regarding slaves, was following his idea expressed elsewhere, when he said: If someone renounces ownership of his slave and thus the slave remains without a master, the slave is free, without needing a document of emancipation. As it is said regarding the Passover sacrifice: Any slave of a man purchased with money after being circumcised may eat (Ex. 12:44). Now, since it is specified of a man, should we apply the rule only to the slave of a man and not to the slave of a woman!? Obviously not. Therefore, the seemingly superfluous specification of the verse teaches that a slave who has a master who has power over him is called a slave because he is subordinate to someone; however, a slave who does not have a master who has power over him is no longer called a slave and can marry a free Jewish woman.
* **23a** Rabbah said: What is the reason of Rabbi Shim'on ben Elazar, according to whom the slave cannot receive the document of emancipation directly? He learns it from a gezerah shavah that compares "for her" (Lev. 19:20) said regarding the document of emancipation of a Canaanite female slave, and "for her" (Deut. 24:1) said regarding the divorce of a woman: just as a woman is not divorced until her husband takes the document of divorce out of his property to a property that does not belong to him, so too the slave is not freed until his master takes the document of emancipation out of his property to a property that does not belong to him.
* **18a** The Master said in the cited baraita: There are rules for the Jewish slave that do not apply to the Jewish female slave. A contradiction is noted regarding our Mishnah: The Jewish female slave has an advantage over him, the male slave, because she acquires herself with the signs of puberty.
* **24b** What is the reason of Rabbi Shim'on that requires writing a document of emancipation? He deduces it from a gezerah shavah on the expression "to send away," which also appears in the divorce of a woman: just as one divorces a woman with a document, so too a slave is freed with a document.
