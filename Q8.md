* **25b** A large animal is bought with the mesirah, the delivery, while a small one is bought with the hagbahah, the lifting, according to Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Eliezer; however, the Sages say: A small animal is bought with the meshikhah, pulling it towards oneself.
* **25b** Indeed, yes, he has reconsidered. Rav speaks in accordance with the opinion of the Masters expressed in this teaching, as it has been taught in a baraitah: And the Sages say: Both the large animal and the small animal are bought with the meshikhah; however, Rabbi Shimon says: Both are bought with the hagbahah, the lifting.
* **25b** Rav taught in Qimchunyah: A large animal is bought with the meshikhah, pulling it towards oneself.
* **22b** Samuel said: How is the meshikhah performed for buying? If the owner has grabbed it forcefully and the slave has come to him, he has bought it; however, if he has called it and the slave has come to him, he has not bought it. If he has called it, right!? But it has been taught in a baraitah: How is an animal bought with the mesirah, the delivery? If the person interested in the purchase has grabbed it by the hoof, by the mane, by the saddle that is on it, by the load that is on it, by the reins on the muzzle, by the bell hanging from the neck, he has bought it. How is it bought with the meshikhah? If the person calls it and the animal goes, or if he has struck it with a stick and it has run in front of him, since it has lifted one front leg and one back leg, he has bought it. Rabbi Asi, and some say Rabbi Acha, says: The animal is not acquired until it walks in front of him at its full height. From this baraitah we learn that when an animal approaches the buyer, it is purchased with the meshikhah; why, then, does Samuel not consider it a valid method for buying a Canaanite slave as well?
* **25b** Samuel met the students of Rav and asked them: Is it true that Rav said that a large animal is bought with the meshikhah? Yet we have studied in the mishnah: With the mesirah, delivering it! And Rav was accustomed to saying that it is only bought with the mesirah! Perhaps Rav has reconsidered?

According to the Sages, both large animals and small animals are bought with the meshikhah. Rabbi Shimon says that both large animals and small animals are bought with the hagbahah. Rav initially says that large animals are bought with the mesirah, while small animals are bought with the hagbahah, but then he changes his mind and says that large animals are bought with the meshikhah.

* **meshikhà** = The meshikhah (lit. "act of pulling towards oneself") is one of the methods established for buying movable goods or animals. It consists of pulling or moving the object of the sale. According to Rabbi Yochanan, this is a method established by the Masters, while according to Resh Laqish, it derives directly from the Torah.
* **hagbahà** = The hagbahah (lit. "lifting") is one of the methods for acquiring an object. It consists of having the buyer lift the object for at least three tefachim (about 30 cm), while according to some, the measure of one tefach is also sufficient.
