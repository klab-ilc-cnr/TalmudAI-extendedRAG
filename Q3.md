# How can a woman be acquired?
## The Answer from LLM Only
According to the Qiddushin tractate of the Babylonian Talmud, a woman can be acquired (i.e., married) in three ways:

1. Kesef (money): A woman can be acquired through a monetary transaction, such as the giving of a ring or a coin, as long as it has some value (Qiddushin 2a).
2. Shtar (document): A woman can be acquired through a written document, such as a marriage contract (Qiddushin 3b).
3. Bi'ah (cohabitation): A woman can be acquired through cohabitation, as long as it is done with her consent (Qiddushin 12b).

* **2a**    A woman can be acquired as a wife in three ways, and she acquires herself in two ways. A woman can be acquired as a wife with money, or with a document, or with sexual intercourse; with money, the School of Shammai says: With a dinar, or with the equivalent of a dinar; the School of Hillel says instead: Even with a peruta or the equivalent of a peruta. And what is the value of a peruta? It is one-eighth of an Italian issar. And she acquires herself with the get, or upon the death of her husband. The yevamah is acquired through sexual intercourse, and she acquires herself through chalitzah (removal of the shoe), or through the death of the yavam.
* **4b**    When a man takes a woman and possesses her (Deut. 24:1), it teaches that a woman can be acquired through sexual intercourse.
* **9b**    The woman can be acquired... or through sexual intercourse.
* **4b**    The case of the yevamah proves that this reasoning is not valid: she can in fact be acquired through sexual intercourse, even though she cannot be acquired with money!
* **5a**    Rav Huna said: One can acquire a woman (i.e., give her the qiddushin) with the chuppah, and this is learned through a fortiori reasoning: if money, which does not allow a woman married to a kohen to eat terumah, nevertheless allows a woman to be acquired with qiddushin, the chuppah, which allows a woman married to a kohen to eat terumah, should not it, a fortiori, allow a woman to be acquired with qiddushin?
