# TalmudAI-extendedRAG
# Introduction
This repository collects the tests conducted as part of the paper "*The discerning heart seeks knowledge*: bringing human intelligence into AI in the study of the Babylonian Talmud".

Although the prompts were provided in Italian (as the experiment involved natural language querying of the Italian translation of the Babylonian Talmud), all interactions have been translated into English to facilitate the reading of the results.

It presents the interactions conducted with the two LLMs under consideration, both in direct interactions and within the context of their use in the extended RAG architecture that was tested;
