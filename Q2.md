* **13a** Ravà objected to Rav Nachmàn with a baraita: If a man gave a woman qiddushin using an object obtained through robbery, an object obtained through extortion (chamàs), a stolen object, or if he snatched a sèla‘ from her hand and gave her qiddushin with it, she is consecrated.
* **52a**    The following objection is raised: If a man gave a woman qiddushin with an object obtained through robbery, with an object obtained through extortion (chamàs), or with a stolen object, or if he snatched a sèla‘ from her hand and gave her qiddushin with it, the qiddushin are valid!
* **28b**    What is to become the property of the Sanctuary is acquired with money; and what is to belong to an ordinary person (hedyòt) is acquired with chazaqà (act of taking possession). The word of a person who wants to sanctify an object to the Sanctuary is equivalent to delivery for ordinary people.
* **5b**    If that is the case, and he actually says to her, “to me,” what new lesson is he trying to teach us?
* **72a** Rav Iqà bar Avìn said in the name of Rav Chananèl, who said in the name of Rav: Chillazòn and Nihawnàd are genealogically regular like the Diaspora (Pumbedìta). Abbaye said to those present: Do not listen to Rav Iqà. He is saying this only because he has found a yevamà from that place and wants to marry her, saying that the place she comes from is genealogically regular. Rav Iqà said to Abbaye: Is this my teaching? It is Rav Chananèl's! They went to Rav Chananèl and asked him if he had indeed taught this. Rav Chananel said to them: Thus said Rav: Chillazon and Nihawnad are genealogically regular like the Diaspora (Pumbedita).
## The Answer from RAG With Glossaries
The term chamàs refers to misappropriation, in which the owners of an object are forced to sell it even if they do not want to. In this case, unlike robbery, the owner of the object receives the money from the sale.
