# What happens if the yavam refuses to marry the yevamah?
## The Answer from LLM Only
 If the yavam (the brother-in-law) refuses to marry the yevamah (the sister-in-law), the yevamah is free to marry another man.

Source: Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Yevamot 39b.

In this passage, the Talmud discusses the case where the yavam refuses to perform the yibbum (levirate marriage) and states that the yevamah is then free to marry another man.

* **19a**    Rabbi Ashì said: Here, in the verse that excludes the wife of a minor, we are dealing with a yavàm who is nine years and one day old, who joins his yevamà, who, according to the Torah, is suitable for him. Since you could have said: since according to the Torah she is suitable for him, and their sexual relationship is valid, anyone who subsequently had a relationship with her would be condemned in the same way as someone who goes with a married woman. Instead, it teaches us that even if the minor had become attached to the yevamah, and if she subsequently had an adulterous relationship, she cannot be condemned to death.
* **14a** From a fortiori reasoning: If adultery with a married woman is punishable by death by strangulation, and the death of her husband allows the woman to remarry, should not the yevamah, who is forbidden to others only by a prohibition, be allowed to remarry upon the death of the yavam?
* **14a**    Rav Ashi said: However, even for the yevamah, it is the one who forbids her to other men who allows her to remarry: the yavam who forbids her to other men is the same yavam who allows her to remarry!
* **44a**    And according to Rabbi Yehuda, how is the maamar, which even the na'ara can accept, different from the divorce that only the father can receive, if both are valid without her consent? The case of the maamar is different, since she is already bound to her brother-in-law (yavam).
* **4a**    They replied: In one verse it is written: Bilam refused (Num. 22:14), and in another: My yavam refused (Deut. 25:7), in which the letter yud is not written, while here, in the verse quoted by the baraita, the letter yud is written; from this we learn that the yud must be interpreted.

* **yevamà** = The yavam is the brother of a married man who has died without having children. One of the brothers, starting with the oldest if there is more than one, is obligated to marry the widow of the deceased, the yevamah. This practice (yibbum, see) is defined in Italian as "levirate," from the Latin levir, meaning "brother-in-law." If the yavam refuses to marry the yevamah, the chalitzah (removal, see) must be performed. An entire tractate of the Talmud (Yevamot) is dedicated to this procedure.
