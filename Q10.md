* **34a** It is learned from the case of the tefillin: Just as, regarding the tefillin, women are exempt, so from all positive time-bound mitzwòt women are exempt; and the tefillin are learned by comparing them to the study of the Torah: Just as women are exempt from the study of the Torah, so too are women exempt from the tefillin.
* **35a** Rava said: The men of Papuna know the reason for this matter. And who is it? Who is referred to when it says "men of Papuna"? Rav Acha bar Yaakov! Thus said Rav Acha bar Yaakov: The Torah says: And it shall be for you as a sign on your hand, and as a memorial between your eyes, so that the Torah of the Lord shall be on your mouth (Ex. 13:9), behold, in the verse the entire Torah is compared to the tefillin through a heqqesh: just as the tefillin are a positive time-bound mitzvah, and women are exempt from them, so too are women exempt from all positive time-bound mitzwòt; and, since the Torah must teach us that women are exempt from positive time-bound mitzwòt, it follows that women are obligated to positive mitzwòt that are not time-bound.
* **35a** This is so because the study of the Torah and the redemption of the firstborn, both mitzwòt from which women are exempt, are two verses that come as if they were one, and two verses that come as if they were one do not teach the rule regarding other areas.
* **29a** Rav Yehuda said that this is how the mishnah should be explained: All the mitzwòt that fall upon the father concerning the son, men are obligated to observe, and women are exempt from them.
* **34a** And from positive time-bound mitzwòt, women are exempt.
